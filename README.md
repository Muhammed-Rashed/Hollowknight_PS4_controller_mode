# Hollowknight_PS4_controller_mode
This is my attempt at creating a mode to make the PS4 controller more responsive when playing hollow kinght on PC

## Featuers include
- Changing colors based on either location or player health
- Vibration on taking damage, falling from great hights and so on

### Reasons for making this?
- As much as it is a simple mode i just want to do it to learn more
- Also bec i want to have more ~aesthetic when playing hollow knight
